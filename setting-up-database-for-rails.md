Setting up a database for a Rails App
==================================

- Open the **SequelPro** app. Create a new database with the name of the `database` key en the `config/database.yml` file.  
- Import the content of the downloaded database into the database created.  
- Create a user in **SequelPro** with name and password as shown in `config/database.yml`.  
- Give this user all privileges and schema privileges in __SequelPro__.  
- Create a connection with host: localhost (or 127.0.0.1)  
To start the sql server, type in your console: `$ mysql.server start`
